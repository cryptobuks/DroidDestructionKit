The Droid Destruction Kit is a virtual machine image to allow anyone to examine the data transmitted by Android apps.
It is part of the [Big Social Data Project](http://big-social-data.net/) at the [Department of Digital Humanities](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx)
at [King's College London](http://kcl.ac.uk).

To use it, first [download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [install](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html) 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing) and its [extension packs](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing).
You must [install](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#intro-installing) the [extension packs](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) if you want to use
the virtual machine with a physical android device, which is half the fun!

**Check back here later for instructions on how to download and use the virtual machine image.**
